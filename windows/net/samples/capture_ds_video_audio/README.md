## capture_ds_video_audio

The capture_ds_video_audio sample demonstrates how to build a video recorder with AVBlocks and DirectShow. DirectShow is used for video capture and AVBlocks is used for video encoding. Separate transcoders are be used for:

- audio encoding 
- video encoding 
- muxing encoded audio and video

Encoded audio is logged separately as a file.
