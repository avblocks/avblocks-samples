### Build from command line  (cd to samples/overlay_yuv_jpegs_push_pull)

for 32-bit build: 
	
	mkdir build32
	cd build32
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release32 ..
	make
	
for 64-bit build:

	mkdir build64
	cd build64
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release64 ..
	make

The output executable 'overlay_yuv_jpegs_push_pull.app' / 'overlay_yuv_jpegs_push_pull64.app'  goes in the SDK/lib dir.
