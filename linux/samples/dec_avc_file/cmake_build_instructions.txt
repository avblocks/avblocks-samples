### Build from command line  (cd to samples/dec_avc_file)

for 32-bit build: 
	
	mkdir build32
	cd build32
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release32 ..
	make
	
for 64-bit build:

	mkdir build64
	cd build64
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release64 ..
	make

The output executable 'dec_avc_file.app' / 'dec_avc_file64.app'  goes in the SDK/lib dir.


### Build from CLion IDE

The CMake project can be opened directly in the CLion IDE.
It contains 2 targets (dec_avc_file.app and dec_avc_file64.app) with Debug and Release configurations for each target.
